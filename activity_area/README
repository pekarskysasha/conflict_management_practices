Includes ctmm application for AKDE home range calculation, statistical analysis and Fig 1 plotting
_________________________________________________________________________________

Data4AKDE_BC (MATLAB script): 
extracting daily points and creating CSV for ctmm package. Using only days with median sampling resolution < 31 minutes.

AKDE_HomeRange_BC (R script): 
using ctmm package to calculate AKDE home ranges and calculate the statistics to compere the core activity area before and during the intensive operation of the feeding station. 
Only for individuals with at least 10 days in both periods (n=18)
Fig 1 plotting

AKDE_HomeRangeOverlapFS_BC (R script): 
using ctmm package to calculate AKDE home ranges for all individuals (n=21) and creates PMF rasters to calculate proportion of predicted time in the feeding station.

Scrips (Matlab & R) for “Habitat preference" section (see also Appendix S4)
Includes Step Selection modeling (SSF) modeling and analysis

CleanPrepareForAnalysis_BC (MATLAB script):
creating final table of stops for SSF modeling (1) removing walking with more than one functional crop, and (2) grouping stops if distance smaller than GPS error

stopDuration_moveDistance_distributions (MATLAB script): 
Creates the “stop” duration and “move” distance distribution t in in SSF. 
Created a table with last point in roost for making a first point for SSF

SSF_modeling_BC (MATLAB script):
creates the random steps for each realized one and writes the table for clogit

SSF_Plotting_BC (R script):
Performing the clogit statistical on all the models separately and plotting.

SSF_CreateTables_BC (R script):
Performing the clogit and creating table for Appendix S6

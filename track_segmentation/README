Scrips (Matlab) creating track segmentation into “stops” and “moves” (see also Appendix S4). 
The segmented data used for Step Selection modeling (SSF) and for crane-DWV interactions

Supervised_segmentation_Hula (MATLAB script): 
The script segmenting the day points (out of roost) into stops (time on the ground) and flights. 
Using only days with median sampling resolution < 6 minutes.

FindField (MATLAB function):
Using shapefile data of the Hula valley to assign points into habitat categories.

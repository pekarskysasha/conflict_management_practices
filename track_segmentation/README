Supervised track segmentation into “stops” and “moves” (see also Appendix S4). 
The segmented data used for Step Selection modeling (SSF) and for crane-DWV interactions
___________________________________________________________________________________________

Supervised_segmentation_Hula (MATLAB script): 
The script segmenting the day points (out of roost) into stops (time on the ground) and flights. 
Using only days with median sampling resolution < 6 minutes.

CleanPrepareForAnalysis_BC (MATLAB script): 
creating final table of "stops":
(1) removing walking with more than one functional crop, and 
(2) grouping stops if distance smaller than 10 m

FindField (MATLAB function):
Using shapefile data of the Hula valley to assign points into habitat categories.

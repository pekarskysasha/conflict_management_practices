AnalyseChaseActivity (MATLAB script): 
Finding of DWV revisits to fields CSV for analysis

InteractionChaserCrane_BC (MATLAB script): 
The interactions with DTV are found in all distances between 0 and 2000 meter (in sensitive fields only)

Analyse_Interaction_with_DWV_BC (MATLAB script): 
Analysis of diatnces to find the relevant interaction disance
summarize the interactions and luck of them on sensitive crops and make the table for analysis 

Active_disturbance_influence_BC (R script): 
The revisits of the DTV to the same field and the DTV-crane interactions statistical analysis and plotting

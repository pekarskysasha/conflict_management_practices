Scrips (Matlab & R) for â€œDWV-crane interaction" section (see also Appendix S2). 
Segmented crane GPS movement data and DWV GPS data for identification of interactions between DWV and crane in sensitive fields
Includes calculation, statistical analysis and Fig 4 plotting

AnalyseChaseActivity_BC (MATLAB script): 
DWV revisits to fields and cration of CSV for analysis

Agregate_stops_BC (MATLAB script): 
"Stops" occuring in the same functional unit are merged and only the last point is considered for interction with DWV

InteractionChaserCrane_BC (MATLAB script): 
Indentification of all the interactions with DTV in all distances between 0 and 2000 meter (in sensitive fields only)

summarize_Interaction_crane_DWV_BC (MATLAB script): 
The summary of the interactions and lack of them on sensitive crops to make a table for analysis in R
Effective distance plotting (Appendix S2, Fig. S1)
Fig. 4.b. creation

Active_disturbance_influence_BC (R script): 
The revisits of the DTV to the same field and the DTV-crane interactions. 
Statistical analysis
